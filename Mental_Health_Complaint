From 2016 to 2021, Alex Aldridge reportedly experienced an extended lack of necessary mental health care and support, which had a significant impact on their well-being. After initial treatment in 2016, Alex’s follow-up care under Dr. Colin Dundas was minimal; despite an initial phone call where Alex expressed a need for assistance, there was no further support or outreach. This absence of sustained follow-up left Alex struggling to manage a serious mental health condition alone, without the guidance or resources that could have stabilized their condition in the critical period following discharge. Consequently, Alex faced compounded challenges, including severe mental health deterioration and legal issues that could potentially have been mitigated through consistent care.

The period from 2016 onward also included involvement with Dr. Parmar, who, like Dr. Dundas, reportedly did not provide Alex with the level of support required for effective recovery. Dr. Parmar’s approach similarly lacked the ongoing engagement and assistance necessary for Alex’s complex mental health needs. This repeated lack of proactive care from both Dr. Dundas and Dr. Parmar left Alex navigating the struggles of living with a mental disorder and managing medication adjustments without adequate professional support, impacting their quality of life and adding strain to their attempts at recovery.
