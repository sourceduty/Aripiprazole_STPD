The complaint against Durham Regional Police Service (DRPS) centers on several instances of alleged misconduct related to mental health and improper legal actions. The complainant, Alex Aldridge, reports being arrested in 2015 without charges and removed from Port Perry. Aldridge details a pattern of interactions with DRPS and the courts, leading to significant mental health challenges, including attacks in 2015 and 2017, and eventual incarceration in 2019. A peace bond was imposed from 2016 to 2019, which Aldridge believes was based on misleading evidence, and their healthcare and legal cases were mismanaged. Aldridge also claims that police imitated a former partner in court, contributing to the ongoing distress.

In addition to these allegations, Aldridge accuses the police of unlawful entries and harassment in 2019. Specifically, the complaint highlights that officers unlawfully entered the common area of Aldridgeâ€™s apartment building in Uxbridge, Ontario, without a warrant and questioned Aldridge about missing persons. These actions are described as part of a broader pattern of harassment, including a traffic stop and arrest in 2019. Aldridge seeks an investigation into the police's misconduct and believes that their rights were violated during these interactions, potentially leading to legal consequences for DRPS.
